The Cloud Services
Delivery ModelCloud Services Delivery Model
A cloud services delivery model is
commonly referred to as an SPI and falls
into three generally accepted services
❑ SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE
❑ PLATFORM AS A SERVICE
❑ INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICESoftware-as-a-Service
❑Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model where
software applications are delivered to users over the internet on a
subscription or pay-per-use basis, rather than being purchased and
installed locally on a computer.
❑Instead of buying software, users “rent” it from a provider. The provider
hosts, maintains, updates, and secures the software. Users simply
access it using a web browser or a lightweight client from any device
with an internet connection.SaaS Works vs Traditional Software
Aspect Traditional Software SaaS Model
Installation Installed on local computers Accessed via internet browser
Subscription or pay-per-use
Licensing One-time purchase (CapEx)
(OpEx)
Hardware required Yes (PCs) No
Upgrades Manually done by IT teams Automatic, done by vendor
Device-dependent, limited Anywhere, any authorized
Access
locations device
Maintenance User responsibility Vendor responsibilityKey Benefits
❑ Cost Efficiency: No investment in software licenses, hardware, or infrastructure.
Pay only for what you use — through subscription (monthly/yearly) or pay-per-use
models. Shifts cost from CapEx (Capital Expenditure) to OpEx (Operational
Expenditure).
❑ Zero Maintenance and Easy Updates : The vendor handles all updates,
patches, bug fixes, and maintenance. Users always access the latest version of the
software. No need for in-house IT teams to manage the software lifecycle.
❑ Anywhere, Anytime Access: SaaS applications are web-based and accessible via
browser. Users can work from any location on any authorized device (laptop,
tablet, phone). Great for remote work, mobile access, and distributed teams.Key Benefits
❑ Scalability: SaaS applications can scale quickly to meet user demand.
Organizations can easily add or remove users without infrastructure changes. Cloud
vendors offer flexible plans to accommodate growth.
❑ Multitenant Architecture: A single instance of the application serves multiple
customers, with logical data separation. This reduces cost and improves efficiency
while maintaining data privacy. Vendors can rapidly deploy features across all
tenants at once.Saas Examples
❑ Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Drive)
❑ Microsoft 365
❑ Salesforce (CRM)
❑ Zoom (video conferencing)
❑ Dropbox (file storage)Platform-as-a-Service
❑Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing service that
provides a platform and environment for developers to build, test,
deploy, and manage applications—without managing the underlying
hardware and infrastructure.
❑The vendor provides tools, servers, storage, databases, and runtime
environments. Developers focus only on coding and logic, not on
system setup. Accessible via a web browser, usually in a pay-as-you-
go model.PaaS Works vs Traditional Software
Traditional In-House

Software Deployment Manual One-click or automated
Setup Cost High Low (pay-as-you-go)
Built-in multi-user
Collaboration Limited, manual sharing

❑ Cost Efficiency: No need to buy physical hardware or install tools. Pay only for the
resources and tools you use. Ideal for startups and small teams.
❑ Faster Application Development : Ready-to-use development tools (e.g., editors,
frameworks). Reduces setup time. Focus stays on coding, not infrastructure.
❑ Anywhere, Anytime Access: Developers can code, test, and deploy from
anywhere via browser. Enables real-time collaboration among teams in different
locationsKey Benefits
❑ Scalability: Easily scale applications based on usage and demand. Cloud providers
manage load balancing and failover.
❑ Security Maintenance and Automatic Updates : Security, patching, backups, and
updates handled by vendor. Developers don’t need to worry about infrastructure
vulnerabilities. Development tools, libraries, and backend platforms are kept up to
date by the providerPaas Examples
❑ Google - Google App Engine
❑ Microsoft - Azure App Services
❑ Oracle - Oracle Cloud Platform
❑ Amazon - AWS Elastic BeanstalkInfrastructure-as-a-Service
❑Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service
model that delivers virtualized computing resources like servers,
storage, and networking over the internet.
❑Users rent infrastructure instead of buying physical hardware. It
provides the foundation for running operating systems, applications,
and data storage. The cloud provider manages the physical hardware,
while the user controls the operating system, software, and apps.IaaS Works vs Traditional Software
Feature Traditional Hosting IaaS Model
Infrastructure Setup On-premise hardware Provided virtually by vendor
Upfront capital investment
Cost Model Pay-as-you-go (OpEx)
(CapEx)
Scalability Fixed capacity Highly scalable on demand
Vendor maintains
Maintenance User maintains hardware
infrastructure
Deployment Time Slow (weeks or months) Fast (minutes to hours)Key Benefits
❑ Cost Efficiency: Pay only for what you use (CPU, storage, bandwidth, etc.). Avoids
large capital expenses on physical hardware.
❑ Scalability and Flexibility : Scale up or down computing resources instantly based
on workload. Supports dynamic business needs without hardware limitations.
❑ No Hardware Maintenance: The cloud provider manages servers, power, cooling,
and physical security. Reduces the burden on internal IT teams.
❑ Faster Time to Deploy : Deploy servers and resources in minutes. Enables rapid
testing, development, and release cycles.Paas Examples
❑ Google -Google Compute Engine
❑ Microsoft - Azure Virtual Machines
❑ Oracle - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
❑ Amazon - AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
❑ IBM - IBM Cloud Infrastructure
