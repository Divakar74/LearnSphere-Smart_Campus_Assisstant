SecurityInfrastructure Security
❑ Infrastructure security in cloud computing refers to the practices, technologies, and
policies used to protect the foundational components of a cloud environment at the
network, host, and application levels.
❑ Information security practitioners commonly use this approach; therefore, it is readily
familiar to them.
❑ We discuss this infrastructure security in the context of SPI service delivery models
(SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS).Infrastructure Security

LEVELNETWORK LEVEL
❑ When looking at the network level of infrastructure security, it is important to
distinguish between public clouds and private clouds.
❑ With private clouds, there are no new attacks, vulnerabilities, or changes in risk
specific to this topology that information security personnel need to consider.
❑ Although your organization’s IT architecture may change with the implementation of a
private cloud, your current network topology will probably not change significantly.
❑ The security considerations you have today apply to a private cloud infrastructure, too.
❑ And the security tools you have in place (or should have in place) are also necessary
for a private cloud and operate in the same way.NETWORK LEVELNETWORK LEVEL
❑ Illustrates a private extranet architecture using a private cloud setup, which integrates
multiple security zones connected via high-availability (HA) firewalls and intrusion
detection systems (IDS).
❑ Internet traffic from two ISPs is routed through redundant routers with dual-homed
connectivity, feeding into HA firewalls that distribute traffic to distinct security zones.
❑ The DMZ (Zone 1) hosts public-facing servers (email, web, virus scanning), while the
Corporate Portal (Zone 2) manages internal services like databases and backups. A
secure Extranet (Zone 3) connects to business partners via VPN, and the Intranet
(Zone 4) serves corporate end users. All zones are monitored with IDS/IPS/DLP
systems.
❑ The Security Management zone (Zone 5) oversees system-wide controls, including
firewalls, PKI, and network security, ensuring layered protection and isolated access
across the infrastructure.NETWORK LEVEL
❑ If you have a private extranet in place (e.g., for premium customers or strategic
partners), for practical purposes you probably have the network topology for a private
cloud in place already.
❑ However, if you choose to use public cloud services, changing security requirements
will require changes to your network topology.
❑ You must address how your existing network topology interacts with your cloud
provider’s network topology.
❑ There are three significant risk factors in this use case:NETWORK LEVEL
❑ Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your organization’s data-in-transit to
and from your public cloud provider.
❑ Ensuring proper access control (authentication, authorization, and auditing) to
whatever resources you are using at your public cloud provider
❑ Ensuring the availability of the Internet-facing resources in a public cloud that are
being used by your organization, or have been assigned to your organization by your
public cloud providersNETWORK LEVEL MITIGATION
❑ First, note that network-level risks exist regardless of what aspects of “cloud
computing” services are being used (e.g., software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-
service, or infrastructure-as-a-service).
❑ The primary determination of risk level is therefore not which *aaS is being used, but
rather whether your organization intends to use or is using a public, private, or hybrid
cloud.
❑ Although some IaaS clouds offer virtual network zoning, they may not match an
internal private cloud environment that performs stateful inspection and other network
security measures.NETWORK LEVEL MITIGATIONHOST LEVEL
❑ Consider cloud service models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) and deployment models
(public, private, hybrid) when evaluating host security.
❑ No new host-specific threats exist in cloud, but virtualization threats like VM
escape, configuration drift, and insider attacks persist.
❑ Weak access control to hypervisors increases risk, especially in public cloud
setups.
❑ Cloud’s elastic nature introduces new security management challenges due to
rapid provisioning and short-lived VM instances.
❑ Traditional patching methods struggle due to the high rate of change in cloud
environments.HOST LEVEL
❑ Massive scale and uniform operating systems in cloud can accelerate the spread
of attacks—this is known as the “velocity of attack.”
❑ Clear understanding of trust boundaries is essential—know what you are
responsible for securing.
❑ Compare your responsibilities with those of the cloud service provider (CSP) to
ensure complete coverage of host infrastructure security.HOST LEVEL

VIRTUAL SERVER SECURITYSAAS AND PAAS HOST LEVEL
❑ CSPs do not publicly disclose detailed host platform or OS security measures to
avoid aiding attackers.
❑ In SaaS (e.g., Salesforce, Workday) and PaaS (e.g., Google App Engine,
Force.com), host security is fully managed by the cloud service provider.
❑ Customers cannot directly view or control the host-level security in SaaS and
PaaS models.
❑ To gain assurance about host security, customers can request details through a
Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or third-party controls assessment
frameworks like SysTrust or ISO 27002.SAAS AND PAAS HOST LEVEL
❑ CSPs are responsible for implementing preventive and detective controls on
their host infrastructure and validating them via third-party or standards-based
assessments.
❑ Virtualization technologies such as Xen and VMware are commonly used to
optimize host resource utilization.
❑ Customers should understand how the CSP secures the virtualization layer as
part of host infrastructure.
❑ In SaaS, this abstraction layer is only accessible to developers and CSP
operations staff but in PaaS, customers can indirectly interact with the host
abstraction layer via platform APIs.SAAS AND PAAS HOST LEVEL
❑ Security of the host is the CSP’s responsibility, but customers still bear the
responsibility of managing their own data securely.
❑ The main advantage for customers is reduced responsibility and cost in
managing host-level security.
❑ Despite offloading host security, customers must ensure that the CSP maintains
adequate security hygiene through documentation or audit assurances.IAAS HOST LEVEL
❑ Host security in IaaS is divided into two categories: virtualization software
security and customer guest OS (virtual server) security.
❑ Virtualization Software Security:
❑ This layer sits on bare-metal hardware and enables virtual instance creation.
❑ Virtualization methods include: OS-level virtualization (e.g., Solaris containers,
BSD jails, Linux-VServer)Paravirtualization (e.g., certain Xen and VMware
versions)Hardware-based virtualization (e.g., Xen, VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V)
❑ Securing this layer is critical as it separates hardware from virtual machines. In
public IaaS, customers cannot access or secure this layer—this is managed
solely by the CSP.IAAS HOST LEVEL
❑ Customer Guest OS or Virtual Server Security:
❑ This is the virtual operating system instance (e.g., Linux, Windows, Solaris) that
customers deploy.
❑ Customers have full control and responsibility for securing these virtual servers.
❑ These instances are internet-facing and thus must be hardened by the customer
(patches, firewalls, access control, etc.).VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE SECURITY
❑ If a hypervisor is compromised, the attacker could potentially impact all
customer VMs on that host making security vital.
❑ There is an ongoing "arms race" between attackers and defenders in the
virtualization security space.
❑ Example: A major breach at Vaserv.com occurred when hackers exploited a
zero-day vulnerability in HyperVM, affecting 100,000 websites.
❑ The attack allowed destructive commands like rm -rf to be executed, leading to
complete data loss for many customers.
❑ Many affected Vaserv users had no backups due to choosing unmanaged
services, highlighting the severity of hypervisor-level breaches.VIRTUALIZATION SOFTWARE SECURITY
❑ CSPs must implement strict physical and logical access controls for hypervisors
and virtualization infrastructure.
❑ IaaS customers should seek to understand the CSP’s hypervisor security
practices to evaluate compliance with internal policies and regulations. However,
CSPs generally lack transparency in this area, often forcing customers to trust
the provider’s security assurances.VIRTUAL SERVER SECURITY
❑ IaaS customers have full control over their virtual machines (VMs) and are fully
responsible for their security and ongoing management.
❑ Public IaaS providers (e.g., Amazon EC2) offer APIs for VM provisioning,
decommissioning, and replication.
❑ Virtual servers are often accessible from the Internet, increasing their attack
surface.
❑ Network access must be restricted to minimize exposure—typically, CSPs block
all ports except essential ones (e.g., port 22 for SSH).Customers should ensure
network-level controls (firewalls, access lists) are configured correctly on each
VM.VIRTUAL SERVER SECURITY
❑ Common host-level security threats in public IaaS include:
❑ Account hijacking due to weak or missing passwords on standard user
accounts.
❑ Attacks on systems lacking proper host-level firewall configurations.
❑ Insertion of Trojans or malicious code into VM software or operating system
images.
