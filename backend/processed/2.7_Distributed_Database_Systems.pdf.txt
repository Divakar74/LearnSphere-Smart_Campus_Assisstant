Distributed Database Systems
Definition:
A Distributed Database System (DDBS) is a collection of logically interrelated databases distributed
across multiple physical locations that appear to the user as a single unified system.
1. Key Features of Distributed Databases:
• Data Distribution: Data is stored across multiple sites or nodes.
• Location Transparency: Users are unaware of the physical location of data.
• Concurrency Control: Ensures correctness during simultaneous access.
• Fault Tolerance: Handles node failures without loss of service.
• Autonomy: Each site can manage its own database independently.
2. Architectures of Distributed Database Systems
A. Client-Server Architecture
• Client sends queries.
• Server processes and returns data.
• Simple, centralized control over distribution.
B. Peer-to-Peer Architecture
• Each node is both a client and a server.
• Nodes collaborate for query execution.
• Better fault tolerance and scalability.
C. Multi-Database Architecture (Federated)
• Each database is managed independently.
• Integration occurs at a higher layer.
• Suitable when databases differ in types or platforms.
D. Cloud-Based DDBS
• Hosted on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
• Elastic, globally distributed, pay-per-use.
• Examples: Google Spanner, Amazon Aurora, CockroachDB.
3. Types of Data Distribution:Type Description
Fragmentation Dividing a table into smaller pieces (horizontally/vertically).
Replication Copying data across multiple sites to improve availability.
Allocation Determining where to place fragments and replicas for performance.
4. Consistency Models in Distributed Databases
Consistency models define how updates to data are seen by different users and systems.
Model Description
Strong Consistency All nodes see the same data at the same time.
Updates will propagate over time, and all nodes will eventually see the
Eventual Consistency
same data.
Causal Consistency Writes that are causally related must be seen in order.
Session Consistency Guarantees consistency within a single user session.
Read-Your-Writes Ensures a user sees the results of their own writes.
Quorum-Based Requires a majority of nodes to agree on a value (used in systems like
Consistency DynamoDB).
5. Advantages of Distributed Databases:
• Improved reliability and availability
• Better performance via local access
• Scalability across regions or data centers
• Modular growth – nodes can be added easily
6. Challenges:
• Network latency and partitioning
• Distributed transaction management
• Maintaining consistency across replicas
• Security across distributed infrastructure
7. Real-World Examples:System Type Used By
Google Spanner Globally distributed SQL Google, Cloud customers
Amazon DynamoDB NoSQL, eventual consistency AWS services, real-time apps
Apache Cassandra Peer-to-peer, NoSQL Netflix, Instagram
MongoDB Atlas Document-based Web and mobile apps
CAP Theorem (Brewer’s Theorem)
Definition:
The CAP theorem states that in any distributed data system, it is impossible to simultaneously
guarantee all three of the following properties:
CAP Component Explanation
Consistency (C) Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
Every request receives a (non-error) response, without guarantee of recent
Availability (A)
data.
Partition Tolerance The system continues to function even when communication between nodes
(P) is lost.
Implication:
You can only achieve two of the three at any time:
System Type Guarantees Example
CP Consistency + Partition Tolerance HBase, MongoDB (in some configs)
CA Consistency + Availability Rare in distributed systems
AP Availability + Partition Tolerance DynamoDB, Couchbase, Cassandra
2. ACID Properties (Relational Databases)
Definition:
ACID stands for a set of guarantees that traditional databases provide to ensure data integrity during
transactions.
Property Meaning
Atomicity All operations in a transaction are completed; if one fails, all are rolled back.Property Meaning
Consistency The database moves from one valid state to another, maintaining integrity constraints.
Isolation Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
Durability Once a transaction is committed, it remains so even in the event of a failure.
Example:
A banking transaction that transfers ₹100 from Account A to B:
• Atomicity: Both debit and credit occur, or neither.
• Consistency: Balances are correctly updated.
• Isolation: Other operations do not interfere.
• Durability: Changes persist even if the system crashes after the commit.
3. Eventual Consistency (Common in NoSQL Systems)
Definition:
Eventual consistency means that, given enough time, all nodes in a distributed system will
converge to the same data value, assuming no new updates are made.
Characteristics:
• Prioritizes availability over immediate consistency.
• Used in systems with high scalability needs and loose latency requirements.
Real-World Example:
• Amazon DynamoDB and Cassandra:
o A write may appear immediately on one node but take time to propagate to others.
o Eventually, all replicas will agree.
Benefits:
• Low latency responses.
• High availability during network partitions.
• Scalability across multiple regions.
Drawback:
• Risk of temporary stale reads or conflicts if multiple writes happen at the same time.Comparison Table:
