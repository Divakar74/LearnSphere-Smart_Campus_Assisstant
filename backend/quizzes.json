        "explanation": "The correct answer is C) Data mining. After the preprocessing steps\u2014data cleaning, integration, selection, and transformation\u2014the next step in the knowledge discovery process is data mining, where intelligent methods are applied to discover patterns from the prepared data.

        "explanation": "The correct answer is B) Reduced upfront investment and operational costs. Cloud-based systems typically allow organizations to pay only for the resources they use, minimizing initial capital expenditure. Option A is incorrect as security may be shared responsibility, C relates to consistency which isn't guaranteed by the pricing model, and D is incorrect as replication strategies can still be complex.",

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The CAP theorem states that a distributed database can only guarantee two of the three properties at the same time.

        "correct_answer": "B",
